        "description": "The Dissociative Regression Scale (DRS) measures for dissociative regression which must be assessed before trauma work can be done. The DRS looks at whether a person can use words in a symbolic (rather than a concrete) way, act with intention and direction, does not have significant perceptual distortions, has a sense of time with respect to sequence and duration, and has a relatively consistent sense of self and body. If a person cannot do activities of daily living, he or she is not a candidate for trauma therapy at this time. However, after dissociative regression is reversed, trauma work can begin."
